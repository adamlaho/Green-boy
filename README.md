## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Access to a SLURM cluster with command-line tools (`squeue`, `scontrol`, `sstat`, `sacct`, etc.)
- A Telegram bot token (instructions below)

### Creating a Telegram Bot

1. **Open Telegram** and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. **Start a chat** with BotFather and send the command `/newbot`
3. **Follow the instructions** to name your bot:
   - First provide a display name (e.g., "My SLURM Manager")
   - Then provide a username that must end with "bot" (e.g., "my_slurm_manager_bot")
4. **Save the API token** BotFather gives you - it looks like `123456789:ABCDefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`
5. **Optional:** Customize your bot with `/setdescription`, `/setabouttext`, and `/setuserpic` commands

### Finding Your Telegram User ID

To restrict bot access to authorized users, you'll need your Telegram user ID:

1. **Start a chat** with [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram
2. **The bot will reply** with your information, including your User ID (a number like `123456789`)
3. **Collect User IDs** from everyone who should have access to your bot
4. **Use these IDs** in the `GREENBOY_AUTH_USERS` environment variable (see below)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adamlaho/green-boy.git
   cd green-boy
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   *If the above doesn't work, try:*
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"
   export GREENBOY_AUTH_USERS="123456789,987654321"  # Comma-separated user IDs
   ```

4. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   python3 green-boy.py
   ```

5. **Start using your bot**
   - Open Telegram and search for your bot's username
   - Start a conversation and use `/start` to verify it's working

## Proper Shutdown Procedures

Green-Boy offers multiple ways to properly shutdown the bot. It's important to use these methods rather than simply killing the process, as they ensure proper resource cleanup.

### Method 1: Using the Shutdown Command

The safest way to shutdown Green-Boy is using the built-in command:
```
/shutdown
```
This command:
- Only works for authorized users
- Provides a confirmation button
- Properly releases all resources
- Clears webhooks and connections

### Method 2: Using Ctrl+C in Terminal

If you're running the bot in a terminal, press `Ctrl+C` to initiate a graceful shutdown.

### Method 3: Emergency Shutdown Script

For cases where the bot is unresponsive or the above methods don't work, use the emergency shutdown script:

```bash
# Create the emergency shutdown script
chmod +x emergency_shutdown.sh
./emergency_shutdown.sh
```

This script:
- Forcefully terminates all Green-Boy processes for your user
- Cleans up lock files and resources
- Verifies all processes are properly terminated

### Method 4: Manual Process Killing

As a last resort, you can manually find and kill the process:
```bash
# Find the process ID
ps aux | grep "green-boy.py" | grep -v grep

# Kill it forcefully
kill -9 PROCESS_ID
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: After Shutdown

After shutting down the bot, ensure these resources are cleaned up:
1. No Green-Boy processes are still running
2. The lock file is removed (`/tmp/greenboy-USERNAME.lock`)
3. The socket port is freed

## Resource Monitoring

Green-Boy provides comprehensive resource monitoring:

### For Running Jobs
- Real-time CPU usage (average and per-task)
- Memory usage (RSS and virtual memory)
- CPU frequency
- Energy consumption
- Per-task breakdown

### For Completed Jobs
- Historical CPU usage
- Peak memory usage
- Total CPU time
- Exit codes with interpretation (success/failure)
- Job duration and resource consumption

### Job Completion Monitoring
- Automatic notifications when jobs finish
- Exit status and duration reporting
- Resource usage summary
- Direct links to detailed job information

## Deployment

### Using Screen or Tmux

For keeping the bot running after you log out:

```bash
# Using screen
screen -S green-boy
python3 green-boy.py
# Ctrl+A, D to detach

# Using tmux
tmux new-session -d -s green-boy 'python3 green-boy.py'
```

### Using Aliases (Quick Commands)

You can create convenient aliases for starting and stopping the bot:

```bash
# Add these to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias green-boy-start='nohup nice -n 19 python3 /path/to/green-boy/green-boy.py &'
alias green-boy-kill='pkill -f green-boy.py'
```

Then use them like:
```bash
# Start the bot (low priority, background)
green-boy-start

# Stop the bot
green-boy-kill

# Check if it's running
ps aux | grep green-boy.py
```

**Note:** Update the path `/path/to/green-boy/green-boy.py` to match your installation directory.

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Security Notice:**
- **Always configure authorization**: Set `GREENBOY_AUTH_USERS` to restrict access
- **Monitor bot usage**: Review logs regularly for unauthorized access
- **Secure your token**: Keep your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` secret
- **Test permissions**: Ensure bot users only have appropriate SLURM access
- **Network security**: Consider firewall restrictions and VPN access
- **Custom command limitations**: Only whitelisted SLURM commands are allowed via `/custom`

Additional security measures:
- **Permissions**: The bot runs with the permissions of the user executing it
- **Logs**: Monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts
- **Cluster coordination**: Inform cluster administrators about bot deployment

## Troubleshooting

### API Conflict Issues

If you encounter persistent Telegram API conflicts (error message: "Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request"), follow these steps:

1. **First, try the aggressive reset script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x telegram_api_reset.sh
   ./telegram_api_reset.sh
   ```
   This script performs a comprehensive reset of API connections and waits for them to fully settle.

2. **If conflicts persist, create a new bot token:**
   - Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on Telegram
   - Use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot
   - Update your environment variable with the new token:
   ```bash
   export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your_new_token_here"
   ```
   - Restart the bot with the new token

3. **Important:** When the error "Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request" persists despite cleanup attempts, it usually indicates the token has issues at Telegram's server side and creating a new bot is the most reliable solution.

### Bot Cleanup Tool

If your bot isn't responding or you're getting webhook conflicts, use the included cleanup script:

```bash
python3 cleanup_bot.py
```

**When to use `cleanup_bot.py`:**
- üîÑ Bot was previously running in webhook mode
- üö´ Bot not responding to commands
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Getting "webhook already set" errors
- üîÑ Switching from webhook to polling mode
- üßπ Bot behaving unexpectedly

**What it does:**
- Deletes any existing webhooks
- Clears pending message updates
- Verifies bot connection
- Resets the bot to a clean state

**Usage:**
1. Stop your current bot instance
2. Run the cleanup script
3. Wait 10-15 seconds
4. Start your bot normally

### Process Management

Check for existing bot processes:
```bash
python3 check_processes.py
```

### Common Issues

**Bot doesn't respond:**
- Check if `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set correctly
- Verify bot token with BotFather
- Check network connectivity

**SLURM commands fail:**
- Ensure SLURM tools are installed and accessible
- Check if the user has appropriate SLURM permissions
- Verify SLURM cluster is accessible

**Authorization errors:**
- Check if your user ID is in `GREENBOY_AUTH_USERS`
- Get your user ID from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)

**Webhook conflicts:**
- Run `python3 cleanup_bot.py`
- Wait before restarting the bot
- Check for multiple bot instances

**Job monitoring issues:**
- Check if the monitored jobs file (`monitored_jobs.json`) is writable
- Verify the bot has permissions to read job status
- Ensure the bot is running continuously without interruptions

**Shutdown button not working:**
- If the bot is unresponsive and the shutdown button doesn't work
- Use the emergency shutdown script or manually kill the process
- If this occurs frequently, consider creating a new bot token

### Logging

The bot logs activities to stdout. To save logs:
```bash
python3 green-boy.py > green-boy.log 2>&1
```

- **Python**: 3.7+
- **Python packages**:
  - `python-telegram-bot`

  - `psutil` (for process management)
- **System tools**:
  - `squeue`, `scontrol`, `sstat`, `sacct` (SLURM tools)
