## Resource Monitoring

Green-Boy provides comprehensive resource monitoring:

### For Running Jobs
- Real-time CPU usage (average and per-task)
- Memory usage (RSS and virtual memory)
- CPU frequency
- Energy consumption
- Per-task breakdown

### For Completed Jobs
- Historical CPU usage
- Peak memory usage
- Total CPU time
- Exit codes and job state

## Deployment

### Using Screen or Tmux

```bash
# Using screen
screen -S green-boy
python3 green-boy.py
# Ctrl+A, D to detach

# Using tmux
tmux new-session -d -s green-boy 'python3 green-boy.py'
```

### Using Aliases (Quick Commands)

You can also create convenient aliases for starting and stopping the bot:

```bash
# Add these to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias green-boy-start='nohup nice -n 19 python3 /path/to/green-boy/green-boy.py &'
alias green-boy-kill='pkill -f green-boy.py'
```

Then use them like:
```bash
# Start the bot (low priority, background)
green-boy-start

# Stop the bot
green-boy-kill

# Check if it's running
ps aux | grep green-boy.py
```

**Note:** Update the path `/path/to/green-boy/green-boy.py` to match your installation directory.

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Security Notice:**
- **Always configure authorization**: Set `GREENBOY_AUTH_USERS` to restrict access
- **Monitor bot usage**: Review logs regularly for unauthorized access
- **Secure your token**: Keep your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` secret
- **Test permissions**: Ensure bot users only have appropriate SLURM access
- **Network security**: Consider firewall restrictions and VPN access

Additional security measures:
- **Permissions**: The bot runs with the permissions of the user executing it
- **Logs**: Monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts
- **Cluster coordination**: Inform cluster administrators about bot deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Cleanup Tool

If your bot isn't responding or you're getting webhook conflicts, use the included cleanup script:

```bash
python3 cleanup_bot.py
```

**When to use `cleanup_bot.py`:**
- üîÑ Bot was previously running in webhook mode
- üö´ Bot not responding to commands
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Getting "webhook already set" errors
- üîÑ Switching from webhook to polling mode
- üßπ Bot behaving unexpectedly

**What it does:**
- Deletes any existing webhooks
- Clears pending message updates
- Verifies bot connection
- Resets the bot to a clean state

**Usage:**
1. Stop your current bot instance
2. Run the cleanup script
3. Wait 10-15 seconds
4. Start your bot normally

### Process Management

Check for existing bot processes:
```bash
python3 check_processes.py
```

### Common Issues

**Bot doesn't respond:**
- Check if `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set correctly
- Verify bot token with BotFather
- Check network connectivity

**SLURM commands fail:**
- Ensure SLURM tools are installed and accessible
- Check if the user has appropriate SLURM permissions
- Verify SLURM cluster is accessible

**Authorization errors:**
- Check if your user ID is in `GREENBOY_AUTH_USERS`
- Get your user ID from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)

**Webhook conflicts:**
- Run `python3 cleanup_bot.py`
- Wait before restarting the bot
- Check for multiple bot instances

### Logging

The bot logs activities to stdout. To save logs:
```bash
python3 green-boy.py > green-boy.log 2>&1
```

## Requirements

- **Python**: 3.7+
- **Python packages**:
  - `python-telegram-bot`
  - `requests`
  - `psutil` (for process management)
- **System tools**:
  - `squeue`, `scontrol`, `sstat`, `sacct` (SLURM tools)
- **Permissions**:
  - Execute SLURM commands
  - Read job scripts for submission
